# NLP Emotion Detection Project

This project demonstrates my journey in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using **Machine Learning** techniques. I trained a model to predict emotions from text using **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF** feature extraction methods.

## Project Overview
- Trained a machine learning model to classify emotions from text.
- Target emotions include: **Sadness, Anger, Love, Surprise, Fear, Joy**.
- Achieved an accuracy of **~86%** on the test dataset.
- Model demonstrates understanding of **text preprocessing, feature extraction, and ML model training**.

## Key Concepts Learned
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning text by removing URLs, HTML tags, emojis, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase.
- **Feature Extraction:** Implemented **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF** for numerical representation of text.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Trained using **Logistic Regression** and experimented with hyperparameters.
- **Data Handling:** Used public datasets and crowd-sourced reviews for training.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance evaluated using accuracy and proper train-test splitting.

## Next Steps
- Build an **interactive UI using Streamlit** to take user input and predict emotions in real-time.
- Experiment with **deep learning models (BERT, Word2Vec)** for better predictions.
- Add **multi-language support** and deploy the app online.

## How to Use
Currently, the project contains the trained ML model. Future updates will include a **Streamlit interface** for interactive predictions.
